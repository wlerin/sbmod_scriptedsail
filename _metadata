  "description" : "[u][b][h1]Short description:[/h1][/b][/u]\n- Allows you to easily change your ship's S.A.I.L. with A.I. chips, which can also easily created by other modders\n- Each chip slot overwrites it's left neightbors, which allows for multiple chip combos \n  (Eg. A.V.I.A.N.'s dialogs with the Felin's visuals, or the old Hylotl A.I. with japanese dialogs)\n- You can get more A.I. chips in the collection this mod's in (the link's just above), or with this mod:\n   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947922190\n- Allows to change the object's sprite to any other installed techstation\n(you gotta spawn them (for now), eg. /spawnitem aviantechstation)\n- It should work with any specie and ship on the workshop! If not, you're going to see a big \"FAILSAFE ACTIVATED\" when interacting with S.A.I.L.; please do tell which specie you're using in the forum thingy below! ( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/947429656/2119355556498832921/ )\n\n- It won't change radiomessages (bottom-left corner messages eg. in missions) because I can't (or at least, haven't yet found out how to) change those\n- It *should* display your missions properly, but if it doesn't you can use the \"Fallback\" S.A.I.L. (the vanilla one) which'll see all your missions. Please do tell in the forum thingy bellow what quests aren't displaying, and if possible from what mod! (The failsafe will last until you quit your ship)\n- Probably needs everyone involved to have the mod installed for it to work in multiplayer, or they'll crash when entering your ship\n\n- If for some reasons your ship pet is outdated, chances are it'll crash the techstation, and thus this mod won't save the tech chips. If that happens, please do tell it in the discussion thingy and I'll make a patch for it!\n\n- [b]If you wanna uninstall it[/b], please go look down below for how to do it (that's superfast really), otherwise your ship will error out when entering it! (If you did uninstall without doing it, just reinstall the mod temporarily, nothing will be broken permanently)\n\n\n\n====================================================\n[u][b][h1]Long description:[/h1][/b][/u]\n(just look for the gifs really)\n\nI took the hardcoded vanilla S.A.I.L. interface and rewrote it's logic in Lua, thus giving me the ability to add some fancy features, but most notably, to allow easy S.A.I.L. changes and modding via config chips. (it also has some cool animations for buttons)\n\nMore specifically, this S.A.I.L. will take it's configuration from the defaults, then from the specie's defaults, then from each of it's A.I. chip slots. Each of these configuration is merged, where latest overwrite the oldest if configs 'collide'. This allows, for example, to have that cute Felin S.A.I.L. overwrite the appearance of A.V.I.A.N., that overwrites the dialogs of your vanilla yellow glitch bald thingy.\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/E3qkZ2A.gif[/img]\nThe mod itself comes with chips to change the appearance to the older S.A.I.L. versions, but I've stolen (literally) a good load of other mods' S.A.I.L.s and made chips for them there: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943637272\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ni4SKy8.gif[/img]\n[strike](^note that this gif's a bit outdated, I added the breadcrumb thingies's (home, missions, config) translation and fixed the last one being superbig now)[/strike]\n\nI've also added a kind-of-still-WIP (it works but I'm not sure of the implementation) ability to change the appearance of the S.A.I.L. object itself to another one, with it's animations and everything. It should work with any techstation you can find that is somewhat similar to the vanilla one, but you'll probably need to spawn it yourself via an admin command.\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/gzgHir6.gif[/img]\n\n[u][b][h1]This mod has some caveats though[/h1][/b][/u]\nThe main one is the fact that we cannot read the player's available missions via Lua. Because of this, this S.A.I.L. have to \"guess\" which missions the player has, based on their quests.\nFrom what I've tested this works okay, but it means that I have to manually add the quest <-> mission thing in some table. (I've made it easy to mod that tho, in case I stop updating it)\nIn case of it not seeing a mission though, I've set up a \"fallback to vanilla S.A.I.L.\" button that will temporarily bring back the old S.A.I.L., which will see all of your quests. (It'll go back to the scripted version once you quit then come back to your ship!)\nHopefully we'll have the required Lua bindings soon!\n\nAnother problem is that the radiomessages thingies' face are hardcoded and I cannot easily script them. This means that, even if you have a cute anime S.A.I.L. in your ship, when you run down the lunar base, the good ol' S.A.I.L. will appear to notify you of the danger.\n\nIf you want to go multiplayer with this, everyone participating will have to download this mod, and the S.A.I.L. config chips you've subscribed to.\n\n[u][b][h1]Possible incompatibilities:[/h1][/b][/u]\n- this mod overwrites /quests/scripts/main.lua and /quests/scripts/portraits.lua. Any mod that does the same will result in S.A.I.L.'s icon in the quest log won't be matching your S.A.I.L.\nI only know of the A.V.I.A.N. SAIL mod that does this.\n\n- Any mod that patches the vanilla interface might make the \"failsafe S.A.I.L.\" look different.\n\n- Any mod that overwrites /ai/*.png and /ai/portraits/*.png might result in missmatching S.A.I.L. visuals.\nThat should be everything.\n\n\n\n[u][b][h1]!! before uninstalling!![/h1][/b][/u]\nPlease remove your S.A.I.L. console from your ship. To do so, you can hover your mouse over it, and type in the in-game chat:\n[code]\n/admin\n/entityeval object.name()\n/entityeval object.smash(true)\n[/code]\nThen, once you've uninstalled the mod, return in game, and type\n[code]\n/spawnitem <the name that object.name() returned earlier> 1 '{\"unbreakable\": true}'\n/admin\n[/code]\n(Note the single-quotes then bracket -- the syntax is kind of weird. For example:\n/spawnitem techstation 1 '{\"unbreakable\": true}'\n) Place the spawned techstation, and you should be set.\nIf you do not do this, your ship will error out each time you load it up because some scripts will be missing.\nIf it happens, you can reinstall the mod, do the above commands, then re-uninstall. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Storm_UK and his hobo.lua script, Magicks and the others at the starbound discord's modding channel, and all the people I stole their S.A.I.L. from who haven't killed me yet.\n(And you for using this?!!)\n\n\nAlso available on github: https://github.com/xn-5o8h/sbmod_scriptedsail\nIf you wanna make your own A.I. chip, here's a template: https://github.com/xn-5o8h/sbmod_scriptedsail_templateaichip/releases",
